# Design Patterns in Python

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems
in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint
that you can customize to solve a particular
design problem in your code.

## Benefits of patterns

Patterns are a toolkit of solutions to common
problems in software design. They define
a common language that helps your team
communicate more efficiently.

## Classification

Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of
detail and scale of applicability. In addition,
they can be categorized by their intent
and divided into three groups.
